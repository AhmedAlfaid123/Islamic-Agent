# Islamic-Agent

## Overview

Islamic-Agent is a tool that enables you to search for prophetic hadiths from renowned books such as Sahih Muslim, Bukhari, Muwatta Malik, and Musnad Ahmad. It leverages natural language processing (NLP) and semantic search techniques to find hadiths relevant to your query. The agent also allows you to filter searches by book and re-rank results, ensuring you receive accurate and reliable answers.

## Features

- **Re-ranking Results**: Enhances the accuracy of search results to provide the most reliable hadiths.

## Usage

To use Islamic-Agent, simply run the `islamic_agent.py` script. You will be prompted to enter your query. The agent will then search through the hadiths and return relevant results.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NLP libraries (e.g., NLTK, spaCy)
- Semantic search libraries (e.g., Transformers)
